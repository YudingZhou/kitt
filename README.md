    "Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice, my friend Harry taught me that. He chose to be the best of himself. It's the choices that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right."

"TTCN is a #$%@&* language" I heard from my colleague ( imagine what he said ), I suffered it a lot, it was not only due to verbosity of TTCN3 but also the lack of good IDE ( some of ones I've tried are even worse than notepad! ), 'I was done with that'. And it was then KITT came to my mind. : )

KITT is short for KITT is TTCN tool, aiming at providing a cool and friendly UX to read and write TTCN3 code with. You can use it for free, please share it if you consider it a nice tool. For more details, please see Wiki.
