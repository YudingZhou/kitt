    "Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice, my friend Harry taught me that. He chose to be the best of himself. It's the choices that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right."

"TTCN is a stuby xxxx languade" I heard from my colleague, I was also suffering to read TTCN code, it's not only because it's verbosity but also I didn't find a good IDE even editor ( I tried some, but not so good, sometime even worse), I was done with that. Then KITT came to my mind. : )

KITT is short for KITT is TTCN tool, it commits to provide a cool and friendly UX to read and write TTCN code. You can use it freely, if feel it's nice, please share it to others. For more details, please see WIKI.
