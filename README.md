    "With great powerï¼Œ comes great responsibility." 
  
    "Whatever comes our way, whatever battle we have raging inside us, we always have a choice, my friend Harry taught me that. He chose to be the best of himself. It's the choices that make us who we are, and we can always choose to do what's right."
  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           - Peter . Parker

"TTCN is a #$%@&* language" I heard from my colleague ( imagine what he said ), I was also suffering that, it was not only because of verbosity of TTCN3 but also there was no any good IDE ( I tried some, sometime even worse than notepad ), I was done with that. Then KITT came to my mind. : )

KITT is short for KITT is TTCN tool, it commits to provide a cool and friendly UX to read and write TTCN3 code. You can use it for free, if you feel it's nice, please share it to others. For more details, please see WIKI.
